# Ecosystem
This 3D ecosystem simulation project is built upon a procedurally generated, tile-based grid map that serves as the dynamic environment for various living entities. These entities are categorized into two main groups: plants and animals.

*Plants serve dual purposes within the ecosystem. Some act as barriers, which block animal movement and influence pathfinding, while others function as food sources for herbivorous animals.

*Animals are further divided into two types based on their behavior and diet:
--->Herbivores, which actively search for and consume edible plants to survive.
--->Carnivores, which hunt and feed on herbivores, forming a natural food chain and driving the predator-prey dynamics within the system.

Admin Panel UI for controlling the simulation.
From this panel user can:
1-Can create new herbivores or carnivores
2-Can control simulation speed or pause the system.
3-Can start some disasters such as drought which blocks plants regrowing
4-Listing herbivores and carnivores datas such as (name, gender, current state) from another panel
5-Minimap system in UI panel for checking the animals movement
